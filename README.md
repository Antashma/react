# Mock Marketplace App
Deployed: https://african-marketplace-mauve.vercel.app

The goal of this application was to create a mock market place where users can view items for sale and shop owners can manage their products for sale.


For this project my role was React Developer.  My responsibilities were:
  - creating a page where users can view a list of all users as their profiles by using React and Axios.  When the username on the list is clicked, their profile page displays some additonal ifnormation.
  - creating a form where shop owners can add new products to their store.  I used Formik, React, and Axios.
  - selected site style and color scheme using CSS
